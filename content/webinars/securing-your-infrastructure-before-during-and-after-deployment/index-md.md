title: Securing Your Infrastructure Before, During and After Deployment
meta_desc: >-
  Although the benefits of cloud-native app development are well documented,
  organizations struggle to figure out how to best secure their cloud
  environments without negative impacts on team velocity without restricting
  their benefits. Developers want access to resources to complete development
  tasks - quickly, while security administrators are challenged with ensuring
  the applications and the environments they’re deployed to remain secure. 



  These environments are highly dynamic and complex - with applications assembled from custom code and open source components, packaged into containers, and deployed to infrastructure defined as code. This new paradigm is one where the onus for security vulnerabilities and configuration issues in cloud workloads has shifted to the developers, assisted by tools that help them spend less time fixing issues, and more time developing.



  Join Angel Rivera (CircleCI), Paul Stack (Pulumi), and Tomas Gonzalez (Snyk) to learn how CircleCI, Pulumi, and Snyk help developers find and fix security issues and validate workload definitions against secure configuration best practices. 


  You’ll learn more about:


  Using Snyk to fix security and configuration issues in containers and infrastructure as code

  Configuring CircleCI to verify security and infrastructure as part of each deployment

  Employing Pulumi to define infrastructure and create ephemeral environments for integration testing.
